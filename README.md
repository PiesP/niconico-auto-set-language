# NicoNico Auto Set Language

A UserScript that automatically sets the language to Japanese on NicoNico website to ensure proper comment display and consistent browsing experience.

## Features

- Automatically changes language to Japanese when browsing NicoNico
- Ensures proper display of all comments on videos (fixes issue where comments in other languages aren't displayed)
- Multiple detection methods for language UI elements to handle site updates
- Visual notification when language setting is changed
- Smart DOM observation for dynamically loaded content
- Efficient performance with timeout to prevent excessive resource usage
- Debug logging available for troubleshooting

## Installation

1. Install a UserScript manager ([Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/))
2. [Click here to install](https://github.com/PiesP/niconico-auto-set-language/raw/master/niconico-auto-set-language.user.js)
3. Confirm installation in your UserScript manager

## Usage

1. Navigate to any NicoNico page (*.nicovideo.jp)
2. The script automatically checks if the language is already set to Japanese
3. If not, it will change the language setting for you
4. A brief green notification appears when the language is changed (if enabled)
5. The page will reload with proper Japanese language settings

## Configuration

The script comes with default settings but can be customized by editing the `userSettings` object:

- `enabled`: Turn the script on/off
- `showNotification`: Display visual feedback when language is changed
- `language`: Target language code (default: 'ja-jp')
- `debug`: Enable detailed console logging for troubleshooting

## Why This Script Was Created

This script was developed after discovering an issue where comments were not displayed on certain NicoNico videos. Investigation revealed that this issue was caused by language settingsâ€”only comments in the selected language are displayed. By ensuring the language is set to Japanese, this script resolves the issue and ensures a consistent viewing experience.
