## Why This Script Was Created

This script was developed after discovering an issue where comments were not displayed on certain NicoNico videos. Investigation revealed that this issue was caused by language settingsâ€”only comments in the selected language are displayed. By ensuring the language is set to Japanese, this script resolves the issue and ensures a consistent viewing experience.
